This project focused on collaborating between two pacman agents in an environment which contains poisons and foods.
Some objects are poison for one agent and food for another. This make the problem more challenging and interresting.

Finding the best way for collaborating between two agent and consume all objects in map, should be done by using search algorithms.
Three search algorithm is implemented in this project, BFS, IDS, and A*.
