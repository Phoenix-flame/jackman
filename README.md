Computer Assignment 1, Artificial Intelligence course, University of Tehran.
<br>
This project focuses on collaborating between two pacman agents in an environment which contains poisons and foods.
Some objects are poison for one agent and food for another. This makes the problem more challenging and interesting.
<br>
Finding the best way for collaborating between two agent and consume all objects in map, should be done by using search algorithms.
Search algorithms which are implemented in this project:

1.  BFS
2.  IDS
3.  A*


This project even has a simple visualization tool which is designed and coded by me. It's basic grid map based on PyGUI that each object can be identified by
specific color.
