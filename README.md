First computer assignment of AI course, at University of Tehran.
<br>
This project focused on collaborating between two pacman agents in an environment which contains poisons and foods.
Some objects are poison for one agent and food for another. This makes the problem more challenging and interesting.
<br>
Finding the best way for collaborating between two agent and consume all objects in map, should be done by using search algorithms.
Three search algorithm is implemented in this project:

1.  BFS
2.  IDS
3.  A*


This project has game engine which is coded and designed by me. Game engine is so simple, it's basic grid map that each object can be identified by
specific color.
