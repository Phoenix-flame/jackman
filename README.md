Computer Assignment 1, Artificial Intelligence course, University of Tehran.
<br>
This project focuses on collaboration between two pacman agents in an environment which contains poisons and foods.
Some objects are poison for one agent and food for another. This makes the problem more challenging and interesting.
<br>
Finding the best way of collaboration between two agents and consume all objects in map, has been done by using search algorithms.
Search algorithms which are implemented in this project:

1.  BFS
2.  IDS
3.  A*


This project even has a simple visualization tool which is designed and coded by me. It's basic grid map based on PyGUI that each object can be identified by specific color.
